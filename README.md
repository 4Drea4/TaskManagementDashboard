## Deliverables
### Project Planning
**This diagram helped me better understand how to set up as well:**  ![Programming flow](task-dashboard/public/IMG_6232.jpg)<br>
 * Project Plan
 * Make dashboard my parent component
 * Create Interfaces:
      - Task Data Structure
      - Component Props
      - Form Data
      - Filter Options
  ###### Component Planning
 *  *Task List Componenets*:
    - Implement list rendering with proper key management
    - Handle task status updates
    - Implement task addition
    - Implement task deletion
    - Add sorting functionality
    - Add a search bar to search for tasks
*   *Task Form Component*:
    - Create a controlled form for adding/editing tasks
    - Implement form validation
    - Handle Form Submission
    - Show validation feedback
*   *TaskFilter Componet* :
    - Implement filtering by status and priority
    - Handle Form Submission
    - Show validation feedback
*   *Dashboard Component*:
    - Compose all components into a cohesive dashboard
    - Implement Responsive layout
    - Add task statistics
    - Handle Component Communication

*   Utility Functions:
    - Implement task filtering logic
    - Add sorting functions
    - Create validation helpers
    - Add date formatting utilities

* Data Persistence
    - Add local Storage integration
    - Implement data export/import
  

 
### Technologies Used
### Reflections
1. How you implemented React and TypeScript features:
    *  Using Typescript and react, I attempted to manage parent and child interactions, controlled input, form submission, setting and updating states and much more. (Some of which I may not get to. )
2. The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them
    * What has been beneficial so far is having so many examples to be able to reflect on. There are a lot of moving parts and unlike previous examples with rendering and using state,cognitively there are many things I am trying to make the connection for that are difficult to keep up with. The complexity of this project is much more difficult due to us combining several projects into one. I am doing my best to continue to reflect on examples, activities and labs to understand what is going on and why. 
3. Your approach to component composition and state management
    * I added state to children components if needed. Then I used state on the dashboard due to the need for consistent interaction on it.
